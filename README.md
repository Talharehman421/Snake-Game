# 🐍 Snake Game in Python  

A simple Snake Game built using **Python's Turtle graphics module**.  
This project demonstrates event-driven programming, collision detection, and object-oriented design in Python.

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Use the **Arrow Keys** (⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️) to control the snake’s direction.  
- Eat the **red food** to grow the snake and increase your score.  
- Avoid hitting the **walls** or your own **tail** – if you do, the game resets.
